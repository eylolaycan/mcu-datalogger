# MCU Data Logger with Memory and Clock

This project is a **microcontroller-based data logger** that integrates a Real-Time Clock (RTC) and external EEPROM memory. It is designed to collect sensor or system data and store it with accurate timestamps for future analysis.

## üß† Features

- **ATmega328P-AU** microcontroller (TQFP package)
- **DS1337S+ Real-Time Clock** with 32.768kHz crystal for precise timestamping
- **Two 24LC1025 EEPROMs** (I2C) for 256 KB non-volatile memory
- ISP programming and UART debugging headers
- Status LEDs and reset circuitry
- **Two PCB layout versions:**
  - üü¢ **2-layer** (cost-efficient prototyping)
  - üîµ **4-layer** (optimized for signal integrity and EMI performance)

## üîç Notes

- The design is **based on guided tutorials** and **open-source references**, but modified for personal understanding and improvement.
- EEPROM addresses and pull-up resistors are configured for standard I2C communication.
- RTC supports battery backup for long-term timekeeping even when power is lost.
